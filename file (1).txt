Pup seal wanders into the Crab Bar

Have you ever seen a seal climbing stairs? Me neither, of course, probably no one except the owners of the Crab Bar in the streets of The New Avenida. Today's afternoon was full of normal customers and a rare visitor, a pup seal.




The seal wandered into the bar around 6:00 pm. Crab Bar is an animal friendly bar, the owner first thought that there was a dog running in the terrace without looking close, she went outside and it started running in circles. Ella, the place owner, noticed that it wasn't a dog, it was a seal!







My first conclusion was: Oh! A dog again. But I doubt dogs have Fore Flippers.

The pup, apparently lost and curious, was also running around and went to hide inside the restroom of the place. One of the waitresses tried to trap the seal with her sweater but it kept running away. Finally with a piece of lax they attract the seal to the exit and take it to the shore again.

In some places like New Zealand it is very common that seal pups, at some months of the year, explore the urbanisms outside the ocean. In this country is called “silly season” where seals pop up in unexpected places like houses, golf courts, etc. The New Zealand’s Department of Conservation receives numerous reports from the public about seals in urban areas around this time of the year.



“It’s not unusual for curious young seals to show up in unexpected places, as they follow rivers and streams up to 15 km inland.”



 Says a marine biologist of the zone.
